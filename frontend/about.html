                <h3 class="service-title">Crop Prediction</h3>
                <p>By analyzing your soil type, our app can suggest the most suitable crops for your land. We use advanced algorithms and a vast database of agricultural information to match your soil's unique composition with the specific needs of various plants. This takes the guesswork out of planting and sets you up for success from day one.</p>

                <h3 class="service-title">Fertilizer Recommendations</h3>
                <p>We don't just tell you what to plant; we also tell you how to nourish it. Based on your soil's nutrient profile and the chosen crop, our app provides customized fertilizer recommendations. This ensures your plants get exactly what they need, promoting healthier growth and a more bountiful harvest while minimizing waste and environmental impact.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Our Story/Vision</h2>
            <p>Farmers in India face several persistent challenges—unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and a lack of tailored agricultural guidance. These factors contribute to poor crop yields and financial instability.</p>
            <p>The question we asked ourselves was: Can we help farmers make smarter, data-driven decisions—without needing technical expertise?</p>
            <p>That's what led us to our project: a Smart Crop and Fertilizer Suggestion App, powered by soil data and machine learning. Our goal is to bridge the gap between advanced technology and grassroots farming needs.</p>
